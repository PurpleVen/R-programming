** Need to segregate waste **
It helps in recycling and proper disposal of waste.  It is essential that waste is put in separate bins so that it can be appropriately dealt with. If waste is not segregated properly, it gets mixed up in landfills. Some of these can contaminate ground water and release methane gas causing severe problems to the surrounding environment.

## Motivation
The main motivation behind this simple shiny app is to make it easier to locate dustbins in Varanasi along with localities.

## Data:
Data for the Varanasi Analysis application is sourced from [Open Government Data Platform](https://dataspace.niua.org/dataset/varanasi)


## Data limitation
One of the limitations of this application is that the data is not accurate.  There are  NA values for latitude and longitude of Landmarks in Varanasi.

Hence when we create the shiny application we will ignore these points. I am in a process to update these points.

## Help:
In case you observe the data projected on map is incorrect and you have more accurate or additional information that could be updated it will be great if you can email us (Team: Data Dive) and we will update the same.
