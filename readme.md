## *Need to segregate waste:*

#### It helps in recycling and proper disposal of waste.  It is essential that waste is put in separate bins so that it can be appropriately dealt with. If waste is not segregated properly, it gets mixed up in landfills. Some of these can contaminate ground water and release methane gas causing severe problems to the surrounding environment.

## *Motive:*
#### The main motive behind this simple shiny app is to make it easier to locate dustbins along with its locations in Varanasi Smart city.

## *Data:*
#### Data for the Varanasi Analysis application is sourced from [Open Government Data Platform](https://dataspace.niua.org/dataset/varanasi)


## *Data limitation:*
#### There are  NA values for latitude and longitude of Landmarks in Varanasi city which was needed to plot the map for comparison between landmarks and Dustbins.

#### Hence when we create the shiny application we will ignore the point.

## *Help:*
#### In case you observe the data projected on map to be inaccurate, and you have more accurate or additional information that could be updated, please reach out to us via email (Team: Data Dive) and we will update the same.
